At the end of this chapter you will be able to :

* Deploy a Knative service.
* Deploy multiple revisions of a service.
* Run different revisions of a service via traffic definition.

Navigate to the tutorial chapter's folder {basics-repo}:

[#basics-nav-folder]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cd $TUTORIAL_HOME/{basics-repo}

The following snippet shows what a Knative service YAML looks like:

.link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/{service-file}[{service-file}]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::serving:example${basics-repo}/{service-file}[]
----

The service can be deployed using the following command:

include::serving:partial$deploy-knative-resources.adoc[tags=tab-1;basic;tab-2]

kubectl get deployments -n {tutorial-namespace}

The `http` command should return a response containing a line similar to:

[source,bash]
[.console-output]
----
Hi  greeter => '6fee83923a9f' : 1

NOTE: Sometimes the response might not be returned immediately especially when the pod is coming up from dormant state. In that case, repeat service invocation.

[#basics-see-what-you-have-deployed]
== See what you have deployed

The service-based deployment strategy that we did now will create many Knative resources, the following commands will help you to query and find what has been deployed.

[#basics-show-knative-services]
=== service

[#basics-show-knative-configs]
=== configuration

include::serving:partial$knative-objects.adoc[tag=knative-configs]

[#deploying-new-revision]
== Deploy a New Revision of a Service

.Twelve-factor app
****
https://12factor.net/[12factor.net] defines the twelve-factor app as a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:

- Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
- Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments;
- Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
- Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;
- And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.
- The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc).
****
 
To deploy a new revision of the greeter service, we will add an environment variable to the existing service as shown below:

[#basics-service-rev2]
=== Service revision 2

:service-file: service-env.yaml

.link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/{service-file}[{service-file}]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::serving:example${basics-repo}/{service-file}[]
----

Adding an environment variable that will be used as the message prefix

Let us deploy the new revision using the command:

include::serving:partial$deploy-knative-resources.adoc[tags=tab-1;env;tab-2]

Updating Service 'greeter' in namespace 'knativetutorial':

  0.026s The Configuration is still working to reflect the latest desired specification.
 13.509s Traffic is not yet migrated to the latest revision.
 13.554s Ingress has not yet been reconciled.
 13.618s unsuccessfully observed a new generation
 13.781s Ready to serve.

Service 'greeter' updated to latest revision 'greeter-njxyx-2' is available at URL:
http://greeter.{tutorial-namespace}.{minikube-nip-io}

After successful deployment of the service we should see a Kubernetes deployment called `greeter-v2-deployment`.

Now if you list revisions, you will see two of them, named similar to `greeter-v1` and `greeter-v2`.
